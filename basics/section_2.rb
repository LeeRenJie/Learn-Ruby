# var = address array is the rest

# .reverse! is a method that comes with ruby

# Hello world in multiple ways

# Simple Put String

# `.length` sees the str length

# `.reverse` reverse the str
# `.empty?` returns a boolean to check whether the str is empty
# `.nil?` returns a boolean to check if there is value ("".nil? returns false because empty string still has some soft of value. nil.nil? returns true)
# Replace words with `.sub("Original string", "new string")`
# `.gsub("OG","new") replaces all the original string to the new string stated.

# .to_i converts str into integer
# 10/4 will equals to 2 because ruby inteprets it as integer and drops the decimal. Have to make one of the number a float for it to show decimal. eg: 10.0/4 will equals to 2.5 or 10/4.to_f convert integers to float.
# ruby takes it as integer divide by integer = integer. Hence, it will be an integer value. This isnâ€™t just tied to ruby but almost all loosely typed language. Loosely typed language is a language that you do not define its type.
# (10/4).to_f will equals to 2.0 as Ruby will evaluate the equation in the brackets first then convert the answer into float
# You can do concat with "5" * 2 but not 2 * "5". because a string can be multiplied by two but 2 cannot multiply a string.
# .times. For example 20.times {print "-"} will print a line of 20 dashes.
# rand(10) generates random number between 0 and 9
# rand generates a random number between 0 and 1
# .to_i converrts into integer
# if a string cant be converted into integer/float it will become 0. eg "hello".to_i = 0 "hello".to_f = 0.0
# .odd?, .even? to check if the number is odd or even
# comparison operators, ==, !=,>,<,>=,<=- compare classes(type)10.eql?(10.0)=false`. One is int one is float
# define method with arguments(functions)
# Declaration of methods has to be before using the methods.

# get.chomp gets the user input, gets you a string even if input is a number.

#to_i converts str into int
